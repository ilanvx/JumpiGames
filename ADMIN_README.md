## Security Recommendations

1. **Change Admin Token**: Replace `YOUR_SECRET_ADMIN_TOKEN` with a strong, unique token
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure communication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to admin endpoints
4. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for admin actions
5. **Access Control**: Consider implementing role-based access control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **403 Forbidden**: Check that admin token is correct
2. **Database Errors**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
3. **Password Issues**: Verify bcrypt is properly installed
4. **Auto-refresh Not Working**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console for detailed error messages and API responses.
